Hello everyone, today I have to make a python game with my class.

The game is titled, Yams.

For use this program, you must need install the module "random"

In your console, write "pip install random", use random in my program it's necessary if you would test my programm.

If you don't have never install pip, you must too install it, like that --> easy_install pip

If you need admin privileges to run this, try --> sudo easy_install pip

Two people play in this programm, the first ones who have the "brelan", the "square" and the "full" win the game.

Good luck.

Bye and enjoy.
